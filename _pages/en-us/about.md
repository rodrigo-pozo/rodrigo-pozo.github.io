<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/multi-language-al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

I am an electrical engineering student with a strong focus on programming and artificial intelligence. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, where I am researching the application of generative models of deep neural networks (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models, Transformers) to study computational creativity in audio and music.
