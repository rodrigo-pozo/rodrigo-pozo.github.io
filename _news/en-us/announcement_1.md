I am delighted to announce that our postgraduate team from Pontificia Universidad Católica won first place in the "Data Challenge in the Cloud" hackathon! The competition, held at Google's offices in Chile and supported by Le Wagon, Kaggle, and Google Cloud, was a truly exciting challenge.

The task was to develop an innovative fraud detection system, and our team, made up of Luis Miranda, Oscar Loch, Cristóbal Vásquez, and me, Rodrigo Pozo, stood out with our solution. It was a highly enriching experience to face this challenge in such an inspiring environment.
